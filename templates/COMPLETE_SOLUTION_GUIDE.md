# Complete Solution: Fix 502 Errors & Connect Domain + Professional Landing Page

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

Your Flask app at `good-parents-justice.uc.r.appspot.com` is showing 502 errors. I've created a complete solution that fixes the errors AND provides a professional landing page for Good Parents Justice - your Ontario family law assistance platform.

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Google Cloud account with access to project `good-parents-justice`
- Domain registrar access for `goodparentsjustice.ca`
- Google Cloud SDK installed (`gcloud` command)

## üöÄ **Phase 1: Fix 502 Errors (15 minutes)**

### Step 1: Install Google Cloud SDK (if not installed)
```bash
# macOS
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Windows/Linux - Download from:
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
```

### Step 2: Authenticate and Set Project
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project good-parents-justice
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your New Website
```bash
# Make the deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the deployment
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix
Visit: `https://good-parents-justice.uc.r.appspot.com`

**If still getting 502 errors:**
1. Check logs: `gcloud app logs tail`
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Try manual deployment: `gcloud app deploy app.yaml`

## üåê **Phase 2: Connect Domain (30-60 minutes)**

### Step 1: Verify Domain Ownership
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add property: `goodparentsjustice.ca`
3. Add the TXT record to your domain's DNS
4. Verify ownership

### Step 2: Add Custom Domain in App Engine
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains**
3. Click "Add a custom domain"
4. Select `goodparentsjustice.ca`
5. Choose both www and non-www options

### Step 3: Update DNS Records
Add these records to your domain registrar:

**A Records (for goodparentsjustice.ca):**
```
@  A  216.239.32.21
@  A  216.239.34.21
@  A  216.239.36.21
@  A  216.239.38.21
```

**CNAME Record (for www.goodparentsjustice.ca):**
```
www  CNAME  ghs.googlehosted.com
```

*Note: Use the exact IP addresses provided by Google Cloud Console*

### Step 4: Wait and Test
- DNS propagation: 15 minutes to 24 hours
- Test: `https://goodparentsjustice.ca`
- Verify SSL certificate is working
